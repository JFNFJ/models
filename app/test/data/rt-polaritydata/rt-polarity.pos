 I hope I can catch a replay from the debates. Sounds like it was great for <e>Obama</e>.
 So...the theory that <e>Obama</e> threw the first debate to make his effort in the second one seem more impressive is certainly looking viable..
 the rhetoric of <e>Obama</e> tonight when talking about Libya and in gerneral. #onpoint #soempowering

<e>Obama</e> truly does represent all.  Barack Obama <a>pushes for equality</a>.  Who would not vote for that!?!?
 The reason <e>Obama</e> got elected in the first place is his <a>smooth speeches filled with simple vocabulary</a>.
 #TeamBarack <e>Obama</e>'s back!!! ... Fired Up, Ready to Go

<e>Obama's</e> right on <a>jobs</a>
<e>Obama</e> gives precise detail on how to fix the <a>market</a>
<e>#Obama:</e> The way we're going to create <a>jobs</a> here is to double our exports and we are on pace to double our exports.
<e>Obama</e> cracking down on corporate <a>tax</a> loopholes!!Lol I'm just learning about all of those, shit! Haha #debate2012
<e>Obama</e> always <a>lookin</a> good tho.
The key clip from this debate might just be <e>Obama</e> lecturing Romney on <a>foreign</a> <a>policy</a>
Lol I don't even like Romney, I just can't deal with ignorant tweets, and it just so happens y'all are <a>pro</a> <e>Obama!</e>
@Talkmaster @seanhannity <e>Obama</e> knows how to create <a>jobs</a> here... What the he'll are you waiting for??
@NerdRage42 no but it takes from the same program that <e>Obama</e> is jumping on Romney for wanting to cut <a>funds</a>

@OlsonBayley I'M CATHOLIC! I support <e>Obama</e> because I care about my <a>future!</a> An you are being racist! Obama is black, but he is a <a>good</a> person!
If governments don't create <e>jobs</e> then why is Romney blaming <a>Obama</a> for not creating enough of them?
@Adam_Findlay <e>Obama</e> is a <a>Christian</a>
The One Thing I Can Say And I Salute <e>Obama</e> For Is The Fact That He Has Remained <a>HUMBLE</a> Throughout This Entire Election And Debate .

I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same <a>difficulties</a> as <e>Obama.</e> Give him another four tears to fix it
<e>Obama</e> verbally <a>hit</a> him with that uppercut.
It was <a>nice</a> of <e>Obama</e> to show up for the debate this time.
@Slate <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first.

 i stayed off twitter so i could form my own opinion about the #<a>debate</a>s and in my opinion @Mitt<e>Romney</e> did great. #Obama was a hot headed fool
 @orangeinah Still think I'm voting for <e>Romney</e> now.
 @joerogan I think <e>Romney</e> is better because he's basically a used car salesman to me.
 @neo99934 @Mitt<e>Romney</e> @BarackObama Mitt <e>Romney</e> Just became PRESIDENT tonight!
 @Gibson_2012 But if you are voting for <e>Romney</e>, what you supposedly are going to get are "<a>lowered taxes</a>."
 <e>Romney</e> clearly won that. Cant wait til this country is up and running again. #president<e>Romney</e>
 @gretawire <e>Romney</e> won, he made his case, he is the next president of the USA!
 <e>Romney</e> should be president.
 @finneyk <e>Romney</e> had a female Lieutenant Gov and more <a>females</a> on staff than any other governor. Your argument doesn't hold water. Or truth.
 Go <e>Romney</e>! Lets get the <a>economy</a> going again and get people to spend money!
 "I appreciate <a>windjobs</a> in <a>Iowa</a>," stands as the raunchiest thing Mitt <e>Romney</e> has ever said. #Debate

 @CNN poll says <e>Romney</e> was a strong <a>leader</a>!
 @PresidentialDeb    My vote is for <e>Romney</e>. I want America not a socialist country.
 Some people don't like either candidate but I like <e>Romney</e> cause he's got <a>balls</a> and some good <a>ideas</a> too.
 The<a>Libya situation</a>would have been huge for <e>Romney</e> and candy took away the opportunity for him to speak on that...
 I love how <e>Romney</e>'s idea of making a family friendly work/life arrangement is <a>letting them leave work at five</a>. Gee thanks, that's swell.

 @wxyzdetroit <e>Romney</e> <a>won</a> the debate, maybe the news media should be a little more neutral and HONEST about what is happening in the U.S.A.!
 Thanks to all my new followers. Last night, <e>Romney</e> again proved he has a strong <a>agenda</a> 
 I'm voting for <e>Romney</e> I don't care, I don't care.

 Honestly I do agree with <e>Romney</e> on the  <a>unwed parents</a>. It too kids having kids now in days. Too mutts, smuts, and nuts running round.
 I prefer <e>Romney</e> though. <e>Obama</e> was talking things he had no idea about. How can you be talking about <a>budgets</a> based on what 'advisers' say?
 I'll vote for <e>Romney</e> if he  takes away <a>tanning taxes</a>. #tanningprobs
